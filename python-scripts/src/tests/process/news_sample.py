If history is anything to go by, XRP is believed to have the potential to see a 4,000% surge when this pattern finally forms. XRP Price Testing 10-Year Trendline Jaydee revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the XRP price was currently testing a 10-year trendline. This move is significant as the analyst noted that XRP saw a 39x and 650x increase in its price the last two times this trendline was tested. Specifically, the 650x increase came in 2017, which happened to be a notable year for XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Solana Take Center Stage In $721 Million In Institutional Inflows Several analysts have referred to 2017 in their XRP analysis, suggesting that 2024 could mirror it in some way. In fact, Jaydee had alluded to 2017 in one of his previous XRP analyses, where he noted that a symmetrical triangle that formed then had returned to the charts. He suggested that the bullish pattern could trigger another parabolic move like the one that occurred in 2017. Meanwhile, Jaydee revealed in a more recent X post that he was stacking up on more XRP tokens despite the crypto token’s tepid price action. The analyst advised his followers to “stop timing the bottom” when they can just buy the consolidation phase. He further hinted that a move to the upside could be imminent, stating that the weekly RSI looks like a “hidden bullish divergence.” A Buy Signal On The XRP Charts Crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated in an X post that the TD Sequential indicator was signaling a buy on the XRP weekly chart. According to him, this indicator further suggests that the XRP price is “poised for an upswing lasting one to four weeks.” Interestingly, this coincides with crypto analyst Crypto Rover’s prediction that XRP could experience a “massive breakout” by March. Related Reading: PEPE Ready To Make A Comeback? On-chain Indicators Have The Answer Then, Crypto Rover’s chart analysis hinted at XRP rising to as high as $1 when this move to the upside occurs. However, it remains uncertain whether or not XRP will be able to sustain that bullish momentum in a bid to fulfill crypto analyst Egarg Crypto’s prediction that XRP will rise to $5 by April.  Egrag mentioned that the $5 range would only mark the “initial wave 1 of a prolonged bull market.” The analyst has also stated on different occasions that XRP could rise to as high as $27 in the next bull run.  At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.5, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  XRP bears reclaim control &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Coinpedia, chart from Tradingview.com",

However, it remains uncertain whether or not XRP will be able to sustain that bullish momentum in a bid to fulfill crypto analyst Egarg Crypto’s prediction that XRP will rise to $5 by April.  Egrag mentioned that the $5 range would only mark the “initial wave 1 of a prolonged bull market.” The analyst has also stated on different occasions that XRP could rise to as high as $27 in the next bull run.  At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.5, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  XRP bears reclaim control | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Coinpedia, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has made significant strides in its 2024 roadmap with the successful launch of the Dencun upgrade on the final Holesky testnet.  This is seen as a crucial step towards deploying the upgrade on the mainnet, signaling Ethereum&#8217;s progress in improving transaction efficiency, and scalability and reducing transaction fees by up to 90%. As a result, ETH has surged 2.9% in the last 24 hours, breaking its previous downtrend. Ethereum Dencun Upgrade The Dencun upgrade was first activated on the Sepolia testnet in January 2024, following its deployment on the Goerli testnet. This upgrade aligns with Ethereum&#8217;s broader strategy to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs for its users.  Related Reading: Cardano Founder Takes Jab At Solana After Major Outage Introducing the concept of &#8220;proto-danksharding,&#8221; Dencun aims to decrease transaction costs for layer-2 blockchains and address scalability challenges, paving the way for the eventual implementation of &#8220;danksharding&#8221; for further benefits. Once fully implemented, Dencun is expected to significantly increase Ethereum&#8217;s transaction processing capacity, potentially enabling the network to handle over 100,000 transactions per second. According to the network’s development team, this scalability enhancement is crucial for supporting the growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and users on Ethereum. Furthermore, Dencun will have notable technical improvements, such as the introduction of &#8216;blobs,&#8217; which reduce the cost of rollups on the Ethereum mainnet by compressing transaction data off-chain.  By caching data needed for short-term transaction verification, blobs aim to minimize storage and processing requirements, further enhancing the network&#8217;s transactional capabilities. Anticipation For ETH&#8217;s Market Impact The successful implementation of the Dencun upgrade holds the potential for significant implications on ETH’s market value, driven by a combination of factors. Firstly, the upgrade&#8217;s enhanced network capabilities, including boosted transaction processing capacity and reduced costs, are expected to attract more developers and users to the Ethereum ecosystem.  With improved scalability and lower transaction fees, Ethereum could become a more attractive platform for building dApps and conducting transactions. This increased utility and demand for Ethereum could have a positive impact on its market value as more participants seek to acquire ETH tokens. The perceived reliability and forward momentum resulting from the successful implementation of Dencun may attract more investors to consider Ethereum as an investment opportunity. The increased interest and demand for ETH tokens driven by this positive sentiment can contribute to potential price appreciation. Lastly, the anticipation of Dencun&#8217;s benefits and the reactions to its successful implementation may lead to short-term price volatility, with investors adjusting their positions based on their expectations of how the upgrade will impact Ethereum&#8217;s functionality and market position. Related Reading: Microstrategy Buys More Bitcoin: Here’s How Much Profit It Holds Now All of these developments could have a significant impact on ETH&#8217;s price trajectory and position the token in a long bullish trend, if this momentum continues to be capitalized on, the next barrier at $2,450 could be easily surpassed, potentially sending ETH to new highs.  While the long-term implications remain to be seen, this is a positive development for ETH bulls as the network has lacked significant catalysts and has been involved in a significant price correction for the past 3 weeks. With activations on the Sepolia and Goerli testnets already completed, the final testnet deployment, Holesky, was initially scheduled for February 7, 2024. However, it has now been rescheduled for March 2024.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",

At the time of writing, Cardano is trading at $0.4825, with 44% of addresses still making a profit and 51% of addresses currently at a loss. While short-term volatility is likely and the road ahead still has obstacles, the long-term price outlook for ADA looks bright, and Cardano appears well positioned for future success in a wider crypto market bull run.  ADA price falls to $0.48 | Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Crypto Daily, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "Sean McBride, the former Director of Global Talent Acquisition at Ripple, has hinted at significant upcoming news for Ripple and XRP. McBride&#8217;s announcement, made via a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), has sparked a mix of excitement and skepticism among followers and investors alike. His post stated: “Big news coming from #Ripple and #XRP in the next couple days,” setting the stage for speculation on what the news could entail and its potential impact on XRP&#8217;s market performance. However, the reaction to McBride&#8217;s announcement has been varied within the XRP community. Big news coming from #Ripple and #XRP in the next couple days &#8212; Sean McBride (@seanmcbride16) February 6, 2024 Wietse Wind, the founder of XRPL Labs—a company known for developing XRP Ledger-based projects such as XAMAN (formerly XUMM), a digital wallet, and Codius, a smart contract platform—responded with a hint of skepticism, implying concerns about insider trading: Must be quite the news if it is worth entering insider trading territory. Another community member, identified as Faisal, expressed a more cynical view, suggesting a pattern of temporary engagement with Ripple&#8217;s technology: “Another company using Ripple&#8217;s products as a ‘pilot program’ and then never actually using it after?” This sentiment reflects a broader skepticism that has occasionally surrounded Ripple&#8217;s partnerships and the actual adoption of its technology. Related Reading: XRP Buy Signal Goes Off, Analyst Says This Is How Long Uptrend Will Last In response to the negative feedback, McBride&#8217;s retort was blunt: “Yeah, all you non Ripple shareholders can STFU because, yes, big news IS coming, already has come, and XRP is going to explode so piss off if you don’t have anything positive to say.” This statement indicates a strong belief in the significance of the upcoming news and its potential to positively impact the XRP price. XRP Price Shows No Reaction (Yet) As of press time, the XRP price has not shown any significant reaction to McBride&#8217;s announcement. This lack of immediate market movement may suggest that investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach. In a technical analysis of XRP against the US dollar (1-day chart), the price shows a continuation within a descending channel pattern, indicating a bearish market sentiment. As of press time, the XRP price hovered around the $0.50 mark. The chart analysis reveals that the price of XRP is currently struggling below several critical Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) – the 20-day EMA at $0.52319, the 50-day EMA at $0.55345, and the 100-day EMA at $0.56877. This EMA positioning suggests a strong resistance level for any upward price movement. Furthermore, the 200-day EMA at $0.56220, although below the 100-day EMA, still acts as a potential resistance zone. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Highlights Why XRP Price Is Ready For Takeoff Volume indicators show a relatively stable volume with a slight increase in selling pressure, as denoted by the red volume bars. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.08, which is close to the oversold territory, but not yet indicative of a strong reversal signal. Notably, the price is trading near the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.49894, a critical support level in the short term. This Fibonacci retracement is drawn from the major swing high at $0.74902 to the swing low at $0.43085. The price has already breached the 0.5 ($0.58993) and 0.618 ($0.55239) Fibonacci levels, which were previously acting as support levels, and is now testing the 0.786 level for potential support. The descending channel pattern is defined by two parallel lines, with the price making lower highs and lower lows, which is typically seen as a bearish signal. For traders looking for a bullish reversal, a break above the upper boundary of the channel and the nearest EMA would be essential. Conversely, a drop below the 0.786 Fibonacci level could see the price test the $0.43085 level, which is the recent swing low. Featured image created with DALL·E, chart from TradingView.com",

XRP Could Be Poised For A Massive Surge To $10 Even though the digital asset is now in a bearish phase, a substantial price rally might be in store for the coin. Several crypto analysts have been bullish on the token, predicting significant upward movement that could take XRP to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Highlights Why XRP Price Is Ready For Takeoff One of the popular crypto experts who has shared an optimistic projection for the asset is Crypto Patel. Patel shared his latest forecast on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) with his thousands of followers. The analyst believes that this is finally the &#8220;time for XRP to shine&#8221; and go parabolic due to past trends. According to Patel, during the last bull market, the crypto asset &#8220;failed&#8221; to perform very well alongside other tokens like Bitcoin. He highlighted that while Bitcoin reached its all-time high in the last bull market, XRP failed to surpass its 2017 peak of $3.30.  However, he asserted that this was because of the legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding XRP&#8217;s non-security nature. So far, Patel believes that with the recent SEC victory over Ripple, perhaps the &#8220;floodgates&#8221; might be open for a breakout. He pointed out that a 2017 triangle breakdown, which formed before XRP went parabolic, is reappearing on the yearly chart. Patel has asserted that if the coin mirrors the trend in 2017, it could be poised for a massive rally. &#8220;If 2017&#8217;s 40,000% pump repeats, we could see mind-blowing $10+ XRP,&#8221; he stated. A 6-Year Long Brutal Bear Days Over the past six years, XRP&#8217;s price has unquestionably gathered more positive fundamental qualities after consolidating in a triangle range. &#8220;Survived 2,291 &#8211; 6+ Years brutal bear days, this coiling pattern signals Ripple&#8217;s ready to erupt,&#8221; Patel stated.

However, this is expected to occur following a successful breakout from the $0.40 and $0.50 price range. After that, the crypto expert believes there will be no doubt as to the route to a new peak and a parabolic rise to $10. He further underscored several price targets for XRP, while putting his accumulation range between &#8220;40 and 50 cents.&#8221;nPatel has urged the community to look out for the digital asset, as it might be on the &#8220;launching pad again.&#8221; As of the time of writing, XRP&#8217;s price is trading slightly below $0.50, indicating a 2% decrease in the past week.

The analyst delved into VeChain’s recent performance in relation to Bitcoin, offering insights into key resistance levels and projecting a major surge during the anticipated 2024 bull run.  Related Reading: Massive $29.3 Million Whale Transfer Threatens XRP Price With More Sell Pressure According to the Crypto ZX, VeChain previously broke above a significant price resistance on December 20, 2023, reaching almost $0.039 before undergoing a subsequent pullback. Despite an attempt to breach the same price resistance on January 11, 2024, the cryptocurrency faced a notable rejection.  Crypto ZX has suggested that VeChain may be consolidating around the $0.03 price range. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency’s expected goal is to experience a surge beyond the crucial resistance level at $0.033 cents.  The analyst has revealed that a break above the resistance level would give VeChain a greater chance to surge to new highs. He predicts that if VeChain can overcome current resistance levels, then the price of the cryptocurrency could rise as high as $0.04425 cents. Crypto ZX explains that the market’s recent downturn has led to VeChain’s fluctuating price movement along the support line. He anticipates a retracement of around 17.26% from the key resistance level and predicts that VeChain could surge to new yearly highs if Bitcoin succeeds in surpassing the crucial levels at $46,000. “At the end of the day all are speculations, but I am very optimistic about the price of VeChain for the year 2024. I think it is going to shock a lot of people,” Crypto ZX stated.  VeChain Price Update In his YouTube video, Crypto ZX provided an update on VeChain’s recent price movements and current value. According to the analyst, VeChain is down about 2.3% on the daily time frame. He reveals that the majority of the market is also down currently due to Bitcoin’s recent pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Solana Take Center Stage In $721 Million In Institutional Inflows At the time of writing, VeChain is trading at $0.027, reflecting a decrease of 1.51% in the past 7 days, according to CoinMarketCap.

ADA currently trading at $0.4809 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Industry experts remain divided on Cardano’s future. Santiment suggests that the increased bearish sentiment might hint at an impending price bounce, while others exercise caution, citing the lack of definitive follow-through after the initial bullish market structure shift. 🐻 With #crypto market caps ranging and lacking the usual growth traders have been accustomed to since the #bullcycle began in October, there is a notable #bearish sentiment that has taken hold of #crypto discourse this week. #Bitcoin, #Ethereum, #BinanceCoin, (Cont) 👇 pic.twitter.com/c3M4bPxlhi — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 5, 2024 Source: Santiment Cardano Dips Amidst Stability: Mixed Signals Cardano (ADA) is currently navigating a bearish trend, experiencing a 2.93% decrease in the past 24 hours and declines of 1.13% and 10.33% over the past week and month respectively. Despite this dip, it maintains its position as the 8th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, suggesting some underlying stability. Related Reading: Ronin Plunges Nearly 30% After Binance Debut, Raising Concerns About Pre-Listing Hype While the short-term technical picture appears bleak, longer-term indicators offer potential for cautious optimism. The increasing number of active addresses hints at growing network activity, a potential bullish sign. Additionally, the negative MVRV ratio, although concerning in its extended presence, could indicate undervaluation. However, this needs to be balanced against the crucial resistance zones identified around $0.54-$0.56, which could hinder upward momentum. Overall, ADA’s future trajectory remains uncertain. Further analysis would benefit from exploring the reasons behind the recent price decline, potential catalysts for recovery, and a deeper dive into long-term fundamentals like development progress and adoption rate.

This unexpected movement fueled speculations about a potential run for the meme coin in the near future. Market participants eagerly observed the impact that the colossal selloff might have on DOGE&#8217;s price. In addition to the whale transaction, the token witnessed a surge in wallet adoption in recent days. On-chain analytics firm Santiment reported that approximately 414,000 non-zero wallets were added to the DOGE network over the past two weeks, marking the fastest rate of growth in the brief history of the memecoin. Source: Coinglass The growth in wallet adoption primarily stemmed from retail investor cohorts, as indicated by the dramatic increase in addresses holding between 0.001-1 coins. This surge in new users joining the DOGE community can be attributed to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s cult status in the meme coin space and its widespread popularity. Interestingly, while the DOGE price experienced a marginal jump at the time of the whale transaction, the subsequent market trends displayed a gradual downward momentum. The weekly and monthly charts indicated a drop of 1.5% and 3.1%, respectively.
