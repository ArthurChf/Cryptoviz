220,A New Design for Wallet Pages,https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/new-design-for-wallet-pages.html,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000","A new, more user-friendly and simple set of pages designed to help people find
an ideal bitcoin wallet is now available. It includes a step-by-step wizard to
help people become more familiar with wallets, ratings to compare how they stack
up alongside other wallets, as well as explanations of features they provide
in order to help people make their own informed decisions. Aside from the
wizard, a completely new comparative table and selector is available so people
can see how wallets fare against one another. This is designed to help
people quickly find a wallet to meet their needs.
Check out the new wallet pages and curate your own list of
wallets.
The Old Design
While the old wallet pages presented an assortment of wallets people could
choose from, the experience of doing so was cumbersome and tedious. In order to
see how wallets were rated one would need to navigate to each individual wallet
and then browse back to the overview page to select another wallet to see how
the two might compare. It was not possible to see these comparisons side by
side. One would need to use multiple tabs or browser windows and toggle back and
forth, or a single window, navigating backward and forward.
In addition to the comparative difficulties, millions of people visit
bitcoin.org, many of whom are new to Bitcoin, and have little to no familiarity
with how it works. This is further complicated when a person needs to choose a
bitcoin wallet and has no idea what makes one an optimal choice, what the
features are and what they do, or what they need.
The new design resolves these issues by allowing people to easily compare
wallets, see how they’re rated and subsequently generate a list of wallets based
on available features - in addition to explaining things each step along the
way.
Wallet Ratings
Wallets are given one of four ratings - good, acceptable, caution or neutral.
These ratings are applied across six categories:
Control: Some wallets give you full control over your bitcoin. This means
no third party can freeze or take away your funds. You are still responsible,
however, for securing and backing up your wallet.
Validation: Some wallets have the ability to operate as a full node. This
means no trust in a third party is required when processing transactions. Full
nodes provide a high level of security, but they require a large amount of
memory.
Transparency: Some wallets are open-source and can be built
deterministically, a process of compiling software which ensures the resulting
code can be reproduced to help ensure it hasn’t been tampered with.
Environment: Some wallets can be loaded on computers which are vulnerable
to malware. Securing your computer, using a strong passphrase, moving most of
your funds to cold store or enabling 2FA or multifactor authentication can help
you protect your bitcoin.
Privacy: Some wallets make it harder to spy on your transactions by
rotating addresses. They do not disclose information to peers on the network.
They can also optionally let you setup and use Tor as a proxy to prevent others
from associating transactions with your IP address.
Fees: Some wallets give you full control over setting the fee paid to the
bitcoin network before making a transaction, or modifying it afterward, to
ensure that your transactions are confirmed in a timely manner without paying
more than you have to.
These ratings are available to review both on the overview page that includes
all wallets, as well as the individual landing pages for each wallet.
Wallet Features
There are nine features people can choose from to sort wallets by. These
features are:
2FA: Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a way to add additional security
to your wallet. The first ‘factor’ is your password for your wallet. The
second ‘factor’ is a verification code retrieved via text message or from an app
on a mobile device. 2FA is conceptually similar to a security token device that
banks in some countries require for online banking. It likely requires relying
on the availability of a third party to provide the service.
Bech32: Bech32 is a special address format made possible by SegWit (see
the feature description for SegWit for more info). This address format is also
known as ‘bc1 addresses’. Some bitcoin wallets and services do not yet support
sending or receiving to Bech32 addresses.
Full Node: Some wallets fully validate transactions and blocks. Almost all
full nodes help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other
full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to
further full nodes.
Hardware Wallet Compatibility: Some wallets can pair and connect to a
hardware wallet in addition to being able to send to them. While sending to a
hardware wallet is something most all wallets can do, being able to pair with
one is a unique feature. This feature enables you to be able to send and receive
directly to and from a hardware wallet.
Legacy Addresses: Most wallets have the ability to send and receive legacy
bitcoin addresses. Legacy addresses start with 1 or 3 (as opposed to starting
with bc1). Without legacy address support you may not be able to receive bitcoin
from older wallets or exchanges.
Lightning: Some wallets support transactions on the Lightning Network. The
Lightning Network is new and somewhat experimental. It supports transferring
bitcoin without having to record each transaction on the blockchain, resulting
in faster transactions and lower fees.
Multisig: Some wallets have the ability to require more than one key to
authorize a transaction. This can be used to divide responsibility and control
over multiple parties.
SegWit: Some wallets support SegWit, which uses block chain space more
efficiently. This helps reduce fees paid by helping the Bitcoin network scale
and sets the foundation for second layer solutions such as the Lightning
Network.
People can select features that are important to them alongside the ratings
described above, based on their operating system and/or environment.
Acknowledgments
The new wallet page improvements wouldn’t have been possible without donations
from the community, as well as community feedback that we received as various
milestones were passed and presented along the way. A special thanks is also
due to several people who spent a significant amount of their personal time on
this project - Craig Watkins, Cøbra, Natalia Kirejczyk, Alex Cherman, and

better, or if you’ve encountered a problem, please let us know by opening an
issue on GitHub.
About bitcoin.org
Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti
Malmi. When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to
additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread
responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control
over the Bitcoin project. Since then, the site has been developed and maintained
by different members of the Bitcoin community.
Despite being a privately owned site, its code is open-source and there have
been thousands of commits from hundreds of contributors from all over the world.
In addition to this, over a thousand translators have helped to make the site
display natively to visitors in their own languages — now 25 different languages
and growing.
Bitcoin.org receives millions of visitors a year from people all over the world
who want to get started with and learn more about Bitcoin.",,bitcoin

222,How to Help Translate Bitcoin.org,https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/how-to-help-translate.html,"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000","If you’re a fluent or native speaker of a language other than English, this
blog post will help you learn how to get started translating Bitcoin.org so
that more people around the world who speak your language can learn about
Bitcoin.
Thank you to Simon AKA “Komodorpudel” for preparing content to help organize this post.
Getting Started with the Translation Team
Translations for Bitcoin.org are done on a website called Transifex. Basic instructions for how Transifex works can be found here.
Below is a summary:
Create a free Transifex account.
Creating a Transifex account is free and not much information is needed.
Join the Bitcoin.org translation team
and select the language you want to translate the site into. Your request to
join a team will be accepted instantly, and you will be a translator for the
language you selected. If your language is not available yet, close the pop-up,
scroll down, and navigate to “Request language”.
Play around with the interface. Transifex’s interface can be a bit confusing
and it cannot hurt to take a look around. As a translator, you cannot cause any
harm as you can only edit unreviewed strings. A complete history is saved for
every string, making it impossible to destroy previous work. In the beginning,
stay away from the Glossary as this can be edited by new translators but no
history is saved.
Join the Telegram group for translators.
The website maintainer, both team leaders for translations, a number of language
coordinators, and various translators are present in this group. We are happy to
help in case you need assistance.
Choose what you want to translate. Navigate to the “Dashboard” on the top of
the page, then to “Languages” and select your language. You will see a lot
of different resources and their progress. Each resource consists of a number of
strings. A string is a “string” of text on Bitcoin.org. Each string has three
possible states - “untranslated”, “translated but unreviewed”, and “reviewed”.
Only the first state “untranslated” is relevant for most translators. However,
if you find a “translated but unreviewed” string that contains obvious mistakes,
you are free to correct them. “Reviewed” strings can only be changed or
unreviewed by reviewers. The first resource “bitcoin.org” contains all strings
of the main page. Start here. Everything else that follows starts with
“devdocs…”, indicating that these files are part of the developer
documentation. It is recommended that you only try to translate the developer
documentation if you are an experienced Bitcoin user and/or developer with a
profound understanding.
Start translating. You must be a native or fluent speaker for the language
you choose to translate. Please be careful to preserve the original meaning of
each text. Sentences and popular expressions should sound native in your
language. Translations need to be reviewed by a reviewer or coordinator before
publication. Once reviewed, coordinators will notify the team leaders that a
certain translation is ready for publication. If in doubt, please contact the
coordinator(s) for your language on Transifex.
Please take a look at the Responsibilities and Tasks section below to learn
more about the different types of users that you’ll encounter on Transifex
when helping translate Bitcoin.org.

About Bitcoin.org
Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti
Malmi. When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to
additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread
responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control
over the Bitcoin project. Since then, the site has been developed and
maintained by different members of the Bitcoin community.
Despite being a privately owned site, its code is
open-source and there have
been over 3,200 commits from 180 contributors from all over the world. In
addition to this, over 950 translators have helped to make the site display
natively to visitors by default in their own languages — now 25 different
languages and growing.",,bitcoin

Over the the past year, as part of Bitcoin.org’s ongoing content translation
initiative to help spread information about Bitcoin all around the world, many
people have helped extend and update the site into their own native languages.
Thanks to community donations and a sponsorship from Paxful,
translators throughout 2018 received bitcoin bonuses in appreciation
for the time and efforts that they had spent volunteering. Bitcoin.org content
is available in 25+ languages including:
Arabic
Bulgarian
Danish
Dutch
English
Farsi
French
German
Greek
Hindi
Hungarian
Indonesian
Italian
Japanese
Korean
Mandarin
Polish
Portuguese (Brazilian)
Romanian
Russian
Serbian
Slovenian
Spanish
Swedish
Turkish
As the original website domain registered by Satoshi Nakamoto in association
with the technology, and one of the first results people encounter when
searching the web for more information about Bitcoin, this accomplishment
enables billions of people to potentially learn more about it and how to get
started using it as easily as possible. Also, despite being a privately owned
site, Bitcoin.org’s code is open-source.
There have been thousands of commits and contributions from hundreds of
contributors and translators. The open source nature by which the site is run,
helps to ensure that new users are still able to find unbiased and qualitative
information about Bitcoin, to make their own informed decisions about which
products and services might be the optimal choice for them to use.
In 2019, translation coverage will continue to expand across the site into areas
where translated content previously wasn’t available, areas such as the developer
documentation, for example.
If you speak English and another language and would like to help spread the word
about Bitcoin, it’s easy to get started!
Thanks goes to everyone who contributes to make this possible.",,bitcoin

This suggests traders are closing out positions and reducing exposure to volatile crypto assets.  Bitcoin’s Struggles Below $26K: Is The Crypto Craze Losing Steam? The disinterest comes as bitcoin prices dropped below $26,000 for the first time since August, dampening spirits across the crypto sphere.  “It seems the market is running out of steam,” said Lee Reiners, professor of cryptocurrency law at Duke University. “Investors are realizing these assets don’t just go up forever.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst’s September Warning: Bitcoin Faces A Red Month Analysts said that the drop in open interest appears related to the expiration of monthly and quarterly futures contracts, which drained trading activity and liquidity. But the decline also signals fading confidence in Bitcoin’s upside potential amid mounting regulatory scrutiny, environmental backlash, and competition from alternative cryptos like ether.   “The promise of quick riches that lured many retail investors now seems a distant dream,” said Jamie Dimon, CEO at JP Morgan. “The crypto craze appears to be losing momentum fast.” Two days ago JPMorgan said: ”the bottom of this #Bitcoin crash is nearing” Honestly, this only makes me bearish… pic.twitter.com/mIAjjatrDG — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) August 27, 2023 Bitcoin has struggled to regain traction since its record high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021. Though some crypto bulls remain hopeful, continued lackluster performance could stall wider adoption. Exploring The Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Declining Fortunes One significant factor is the regulatory scrutiny that has intensified worldwide. Governments and financial authorities are increasingly concerned about the potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including money laundering and tax evasion. This regulatory uncertainty has made some investors wary and hesitant to enter or remain in the market. Bitcoin has faced backlash due to its environmental impact. Critics argue that the energy-intensive process of mining Bitcoin is unsustainable and contributes to carbon emissions. As environmental concerns take center stage, some investors and institutions may reevaluate their support for Bitcoin in favor of more environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin pioneered, newer cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have gained traction, offering innovative features such as smart contracts and decentralized applications. These alternatives have attracted both developers and investors, diverting attention away from Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Future: Crossroads For The Original Crypto For diehard believers, bitcoin’s funk may present a buying opportunity if prices continue drifting lower. But others argue that “digital gold” has lost its luster for good. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Load Up With $1.5 Billion Worth Of BTC Amidst Price Uncertainty “It’s yet to be seen whether Bitcoin can reclaim its role as the crypto market’s flagship,” said Chen Alicia, a student of blockchain studies at NYU.

152,GALA Sinks 72% In 2023 Alone – Blame Internal Wrangles And Lawsuits?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/gala-sinks-72-in-2023-alone-blame-internal-wrangles-and-lawsuits/,"Sun, 03 Sep 2023 10:44:46 +0000","GALA, the native token of Gala Games, is under immense selling pressure as of early September 2023. Trackers show that the token is down 72% from 2023 peaks when it soared to $0.062 in late January 2023. From there, the token has been edging lower, sinking to $0.017 at spot rates, unwinding over 95% of gains posted in early 2023. To illustrate, GALA is cents away from retesting all-time lows registered in late 2022 at around $0.016. GALA Plunging The drawdown could be pinned to the unfavorable market-wide bear market conditions that have seen top coins, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, surge before dumping, dragging altcoins even lower. The slowdown across Bitcoin has been mirrored in GALA as the token edges lower, reversing gains posted on August 29.  On this day, Bitcoin rose after a US Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Grayscale, the issuer of GBTC. Even though the court didn’t direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert GBTC trust to an exchange-traded fund (ETF), the judge didn’t provide clear reasons why they denied Grayscale’s request. BTC prices rallied as odds of the US approving a spot Bitcoin ETF rose, lifting altcoins, including GALA. However, bears have successfully peeled back losses, as the daily chart shows. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst’s September Warning: Bitcoin Faces A Red Month CEO Versus Co-Founder Beyond market factors, GALA may plunge to all-time lows primarily because of internal wrangles that could heap more pressure on the token that’s already struggling against unrelenting bears. Court documents show that CEO Eric Schiermeyer and co-founder Wright Thurston filed lawsuits against each other.  Filings show that Schiermeyer blames the co-founder for illegally obtaining and selling $130 million of GALA. The CEO also claims the co-founder stole node licenses for operating nodes within the Gala game ecosystem. He also cites Thurston’s history of founding companies that often in bankruptcy. The CEO wants the co-founder replaced as director.

The co-founder claims the CEO misused millions, including $600 million of assets, and lending millions of dollars from Gala Games to himself. They also alleged that the CEO created entities in Switzerland and Dubai that, in reality, should belong to Gala Games. The co-founder wants to kick out the CEO, who has held the office since 2021.

According to data from blockchain tracker Whale Alert, XRP whales conducted transactions involving over a billion XRP on Friday, September 1.  Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction – Topside Bias Vulnerable Unless Bulls Clear This Hurdle Ripple Transfers 75 Million XRP To Unknown Wallet In Whale Buying Spree Through a series of posts by Whale Alert on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), it can be inferred that the XRP market witnessed four major whale transactions.  The biggest of these transactions was the transfer of 424,354,912 XRP – valued at $214,293,666 – from one unknown wallet to the other. In this context, unknown wallets refer to addresses with no affiliation to a crypto exchange.  Furthermore, there was the move of XRP, 19,920,318 XRP worth $10,167,904, from another unknown wallet to the Binance exchange. It was also noted that a whale transferred 66,666,659 XRP, worth $33,065, 809 from an unknown wallet to the Binance exchange.  However, the most notable transaction that caught most traders’ eye came from Ripple, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency.  Whale Alert reported that Ripple transferred 75,000,000 XRP, worth $37,058,145, from its Binance wallet to an unknown wallet.  Following this move, some crypto enthusiasts believe that this particular unknown wallet also belongs to Ripple, as the company could be intending to soon offload those tokens on an exchange. This speculation has led to most investors predicting an incoming market dump.  Ripple also conducted other transactions on September 1, locking about 800,000,000 XRP in escrow.  However, this does not raise any concern as the crypto payment firm is known to release 1,000,000,000 XRP at the start of every month before proceeding to lock up about 80% of the new tokens a few hours later.  Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond XRP Records 7-Month Highest Transaction Volume Among Other Positives Following the massive transactions in the XRP market, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has provided a report highlighting some of the effects of these whale movements. According to an X post on September 1, Santiment reports an on-chain transaction volume of 4.8 billion XRP, marking the seven highest value of this metric in the XRP market over the last seven months.  The analytics firm also noted that there are currently about 2.03 billion XRP in circulation, representing the token’s highest-circulating supply since May 31. In addition, XRP development activity was also reported to be on the high side. At the time of writing, XRP still finds itself struggling amid a general market downturn.

154,Crypto Analyst’s September Warning: Bitcoin Faces A Red Month,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/crypto-analysts-september-warning-bitcoin-faces-a-red-month/,"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 14:30:33 +0000","In a recent video by renowned cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen, ominous predictions for Bitcoin performance in September have emerged. Cowen, known for his data-driven approach to cryptocurrency analysis, shared his insights regarding Bitcoin’s historical performance in September and its potential trajectory for the current year. Cowen acknowledged that September has traditionally been a challenging month for BTC, often characterized by negative price movements. He emphasized that while historical trends suggest a red month for Bitcoin in September, there are no guarantees, and occasional green September does occur. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Sends Important Message To SHIB Holders The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin had experienced six consecutive red September from 2017 to 2022. The average return for Bitcoin in September has historically been around -6.6%, with a standard deviation that adds to the unpredictability of the cryptocurrency’s performance. Examining Potential Price Declines Cowen then delved into the potential price decline for Bitcoin in September. Given Bitcoin’s opening price of just below $26,000 for the month, a 7% decrease would bring its value to approximately $24,000. He further pointed out that in the pre-halving year of 2019, Bitcoin witnessed a 14% drop in September, potentially pushing its price down to $22,000. To bolster his argument, Cowen referred to a recent tweet in which he speculated a substantial chance of Bitcoin reaching $23,000 in September. Although he stressed that this prediction is far from a guarantee, he underscored the seasonal pattern, the downward momentum, and the recent monthly close below certain support levels as factors that make a dip to $23,000 plausible. Moreover, Cowen discussed the average returns in all pre-halving years for the month, revealing a drop of approximately 17.7%, which could result in Bitcoin trading at around $21,500 if history repeats itself. On August’s performance, Cowen noted that Bitcoin had already experienced a 10% drop. While August’s long-term average is approximately 21%, averaging only the last two pre-halving years (2015 and 2019) suggests a more modest -11% to -12% average drop. This highlights that Bitcoin may follow a similar pattern in September, potentially softening the blow to around $24,000. The current price of Bitcoin (BTC) is  $25,813, with a 24-hour price change of -0.99%. As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin commands a significant market cap of $502,654,681,515, securing its position as the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a trading volume of $17,603,174,408, making it the second most actively traded cryptocurrency by volume. This high trading volume indicates strong interest and activity within the Bitcoin market, contributing to its liquidity. Navigating Bitcoin’s Cyclical Nature Cowen emphasized that despite the uncertainty, the seasonality of Bitcoin and the existing downward momentum make a test of the $23,000 level highly likely in the near future, possibly in September or October. Cowen reflected on the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s price movements in a broader context, stating that it often alternates between bullish and bearish phases. He stressed that during pre-halving years, Bitcoin tends to rise significantly during the first half and experience declines in the latter half. According to Cowen, this pattern is designed to “wreck” both bulls and bears before entering a period of sustained growth. He also pointed out that while BTC may face challenges in the short term, once quantitative easing (QE) returns and the cryptocurrency market sentiment improves, altcoins could regain momentum. Related Reading: On-chain Sleuth Potentially Unveils Shiba Inu Founder With Shocking Affiliates In conclusion, Cowen cautioned his audience to remain vigilant in September, historically a month of red returns for Bitcoin. He urged caution, citing past data and market dynamics as indicators of a potentially challenging month ahead. While the future remains uncertain, Cowen’s data-driven analysis serves as a valuable resource for those navigating the turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market. Investors and enthusiasts will undoubtedly watch closely to see if Bitcoin’s performance aligns with his predictions in the coming weeks and months.

155,Bitcoin Whales Load Up With $1.5 Billion Worth Of BTC Amidst Price Uncertainty,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whales-amass-1-5-b-of-btc/,"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 13:30:43 +0000","Bitcoin whales, entities holding a substantial portion of the Bitcoin supply, have ignited speculation within the cryptocurrency realm by amassing more than a billion worth of BTC in mere two weeks. Data from crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock reveals a significant uptick in the accumulation of Bitcoin by addresses holding at least 0.1% of the total BTC supply, valued at over $500 million each. These entities collectively added a staggering $1.5 billion to their holdings during the final two weeks of August.  This surge in accumulation coincides with the excitement surrounding the potential introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. This substantial accumulation of Bitcoin by crypto whales serves as a clear testament to their growing confidence and heightened interest in the cryptocurrency, irrespective of recent price oscillations and regulatory ambiguities.  Addresses holding 0.1% of the Bitcoin supply or more have added over $1.5B in BTC holdings in the last two weeks. pic.twitter.com/MrHKLXO9qx — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) September 1, 2023 Bitcoin Price Upsurge Amidst ETF Speculation The chronology of this accumulation is particularly captivating. While Bitcoin’s price experienced a dip, it experienced a transitory resurgence subsequent to a pivotal court ruling linked to Grayscale’s pursuit of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The verdict translated into a price upswing exceeding $2,000, propelling the alpha coin to a two-week zenith, slightly exceeding the $28,000 threshold. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Drops Below Crucial Level – Will Sellers Exit? Nevertheless, just as the cryptocurrency community was poised for jubilation and pinned hopes on the ETF’s ratification, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced an unexpected regulatory twist. A dopting a circumspect stance, the regulatory authority deferred its verdict on all active Bitcoin ETF applications. Consequently, Bitcoin relinquished all its gains stemming from the brief rally triggered by the Grayscale ruling, regressing below the $26,000 mark. BTCUSD trading at $25,382 on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Institutional Optimism Amidst Ambiguity The current BTC price is $25,808.30 according to CoinGecko, with a 24-hour decline of 0.8% and a seven-day loss of 0.9%. Despite the recent tumultuous price fluctuations and the ambiguity clouding the cryptocurrency market’s regulatory landscape, the continual accumulation of Bitcoin by crypto whales implies that institutional investors are cultivating an increasingly sanguine outlook regarding Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Related Reading: BNB Price Forecast: Will It Break Through Resistance At $225? The prospect of a Bitcoin ETF, promising a regulated and accessible entryway for mainstream investors, persists as a game-changing possibility that could significantly reshape the crypto outlook in the United States and beyond. While the cryptocurrency community anticipates further developments and regulatory determinations, the conduct of these crypto whales functions as a tangible gauge of swelling institutional interest in Bitcoin, fortifying the belief in its enduring value and pertinence.  These crypto whales wield not only the power to sway the market but also reflect the sentiment and perspective of dominant participants within the dynamic domain of cryptocurrencies.

Toncoin, on the other hand, continues to defy the current market conditions, registering a significant price climb in the past day. The TON price experienced a substantial increase on the first day of September, which is consistent with its overall trend in August. TON Soars By 11% In A Single Day Toncoin currently leads the altcoin market as one of the top gainers following an 11% price rise in the past 24 hours. In the same period, altcoins such as ETH and XRP appear to have succumbed to general market sentiment, suffering a 1% and 2% price dip, respectively. Interestingly, TON’s latest price spike only underscores its impressive performance in the past few weeks. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of the cryptocurrency has swelled by more than 35% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Investors Load Up Their Bags As Majority Of Cryptos Nosedive A broader look at Toncoin’s price history shows that the token has been on an ascent since the start of August. After plunging to a year-to-date (YTD) low of $1.18 on the 4th of August, TON is currently on a nearly 64% price rally. The TON token is currently valued at $1.93, according to CoinGecko data. If this bullish momentum and the buying pressure continue to build, investors could see Toncoin return to the $2 mark.  However, technical indicators do not seem to be in favor of the bullish momentum continuing. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), an indicator that tracks the balance between the buying and selling pressure of a token, is currently in the oversold region. The daily RSI in the oversold zone can be an indication of a potential trend reversal. In this situation, this means that investors could see Toncoin reverse all its gains and embark on a downward trend. Can Toncoin Break Into The Top 10 Crypto Ranking? This recent positive performance has catapulted Toncoin onto the verge of becoming one of the top 101 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. According to CoinGecko data, TON is the 12th-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of roughly $6.64 billion. This puts it ahead of Polkadot, Polygon, and Litecoin, who occupy the 13th, 14th, and 15th positions, respectively. If TON continues its current price rally in this existing market condition, breaking into the top 10 ranking might be a possibility. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Drops Below Crucial Level – Will Sellers Exit? Interestingly, a significant 92% increase in the token’s daily trading volume adds further optimism to this scenario.

157,Shiba Inu Price Faces Potential Loss As Bearish Pattern Emerges,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-price-faces-potential-12-loss-as-bearish-pattern-emerges/,"Sat, 02 Sep 2023 12:30:00 +0000","Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently found itself in a downward spiral. Over the past few days, the coin has been experiencing a steady decline, causing concern among its enthusiastic community of holders. The latest development indicates a potentially worrisome trend as sellers breach the lower support trendline of a bearish pennant pattern, hinting at further price drops on the horizon. The bearish pennant pattern is a technical analysis chart pattern commonly used in cryptocurrency markets. It is characterized by a consolidation phase after a sharp price decline, resembling a small symmetrical triangle that slopes downwards. This pattern typically suggests that the selling pressure remains strong, and the asset may continue to experience losses. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, SHIB is currently trading at $0.00000786, marking a 1.3% decline in the past 24 hours and a 3.2% slump over the past week. These numbers reflect the ongoing bearish sentiment in the market. Source: TradingView Shiba Inu Market Sentiment And Volatility One notable aspect of SHIB’s recent price movement is the low trading volume in the market. Low volumes often indicate a lack of conviction among traders, which can result in subdued price action.  Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Drops Below Crucial Level – Will Sellers Exit? While this may suggest that the downward momentum is not particularly strong, it also leaves SHIB vulnerable to sharp price swings should a significant volume of trades occur. Traders are closely watching for signs of increased activity that could either exacerbate the decline or potentially reverse the trend. SHIB market cap currently at $4.6 billion on the weekly chart: TradingView.com Shibarium: Glimmer Of Hope Amid the uncertainty surrounding SHIB’s price, there is a ray of hope for the Shiba Inu community. The successful relaunch of Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 scaling solution, has garnered attention. Shibarium aims to address some of the challenges facing the Shiba Inu ecosystem by reducing transaction costs and increasing transaction speed.  Related Reading: BNB Price Forecast: Will It Break Through Resistance At $225? These improvements could make SHIB more attractive to users and potentially drive up demand for the cryptocurrency. While this development offers a counterbalance to the bearish technical indicators, its ability to reverse the trend remains uncertain. SHIB finds itself at a challenging position as it contends with the bearish pennant pattern and declining prices. The cryptocurrency market’s low volumes reflect a cautious sentiment among traders, leaving SHIB susceptible to potential price swings. The relaunch of Shibarium brings a glimmer of hope for SHIB’s future, as it seeks to enhance its utility and appeal. However, investors and traders are advised to exercise caution and closely monitor the market dynamics as SHIB navigates these challenging waters.

This dip in price has sparked discussions about the coin’s immediate future. The cryptocurrency market has been characterized by considerable uncertainty, with Bitcoin (BTC), the bellwether of the industry, also grappling with price fluctuations. Analysts suggest that BTC might enter a narrow consolidation phase before establishing a clear direction in the coming week.  Given this backdrop, MATIC could follow suit by consolidating above the critical support level of $0.50 before attempting an upward move toward the 50-EMA (Exponential Moving Average) at either $0.60 or $0.65. Related Reading: BNB Price Forecast: Will It Break Through Resistance At $225? MATIC seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Polygon Key Chart Indicators Raise Concerns Technical indicators have painted a cautious picture for MATIC. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in the lower range, signifying bearish momentum, while the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has struggled to breach the zero level, indicating limited capital inflows and heightened selling pressure. Additionally, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) has slightly dipped, further suggesting a waning demand for MATIC in the current market conditions. In the midst of this market turbulence, Polygon has made an intriguing proposition. In July, the project unveiled plans for a token upgrade aimed at enhancing the capabilities of MATIC holders within the Polygon ecosystem.  MATIC market cap currently at $5.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Polygon’s Ambitious Proposal The proposal seeks to enable MATIC holders to validate transactions on multiple blockchain networks, potentially increasing their utility and influence. However, it’s important to note that this proposal is currently pending approval from the Polygon community. If this proposal receives the green light, it would mark a significant shift for Polygon, as the coin would transition from MATIC to POL. Such a transition could have far-reaching implications for both the Polygon network and its community of users, potentially influencing MATIC’s price dynamics in the long run.

With this in mind, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, Lucie, shared a quote from the recently published ShibPaper highlighting the token’s importance in the ecosystem and the roles holders will play. Related Reading: On-chain Sleuth Potentially Unveils Shiba Inu Founder With Shocking Affiliates SHIB Remains The Core In a tweet, Lucie shared the second chapter of the whitepaper, where SHIB is mentioned as the “core” of the ecosystem. The document also labels the token as “one of the greatest currencies in the history of mankind.” To emphasize the importance of SHIB in the ecosystem, The ShibPaper states that the token would take a “new, yet critical role” in the governance of the Shiba Inu State. The token will be the community’s voice in many decisions. The ShibPaper, in chapter one, revealed that SHIB would be one of the governance tokens for the SHIB Inu State. In chapter two, it went further to give an insight into how governance of the decentralized state will look like. According to the document, every Shibizen (citizen of the Shiba Inu State) would be allowed to vote on important decisions as long as they hold “One SHIB.” @LucieSHIB serious question: don’t you think allowing holders of just 1 Shib to vote is enabling malicious actors? They can distribute small amounts of Shib into many wallets, then vote in a way that is not the best for the ecosystem. Any thoughts from #SHIBARMY and @Shibtoken? https://t.co/SvMDEKmJEg — Mike S (@crypto_is_great) August 31, 2023 However, following Lucie’s tweet, a user quickly pointed out a downside of this move as he questioned whether or not this move could enable “malicious actors” who would simply distribute 1 SHIB across many wallets and then vote against proposals that may benefit the ecosystem.  Shiba Inu’s Growth SHIB has tremendously grown since it launched in 2020, becoming one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap (currently 16th at the time of writing). As part of plans to continue to bolster the token, the team plans to maintain its deflationary nature as several SHIB tokens are set to be burned in a move that will decrease its supply.  According to data from Shibburn, SHIB currently has a total supply of 589 trillion SHIB, with 410 trillion SHIB already burned from its initial supply of 999 trillion SHIB. SHIB market cap currently at $4.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com This move is expected to increase SHIB’s value as a reduced circulation supply creates an increased scarcity, thereby making the token more valuable. However, the team is cautious about promising the community that SHIB’s price is bound to increase significantly in the future.  Related Reading: Grayscale Victory Sends Bitcoin Open Interest Surging After Hitting One-Year Lows Meanwhile, Shibarium’s success is also projected to help boost SHIB’s value, considering that increased trading activity on the layer-2 network invariably means more utility for the token.

160,On-chain Sleuth Potentially Unveils Shiba Inu Founder With Shocking Affiliates,https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-founder/,"Fri, 01 Sep 2023 23:00:45 +0000","The identity of the mind behind the Shiba Inu meme coin has been a long-standing crypto mystery since it first debuted in 2020. So far, there has been no concrete proof as to who it might be with guesses ranging from FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried to Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin. Despite having little success so far, crypto investigators have not given up as a new theory has popped up as to the creator behind Shiba Inu. Has The Shiba Inu Founder Been Identified? An X (formerly Twitter) user identified by the username @boringsleuth first drew attention on Thursday, August 1, after they posted an elaborate theory as to who the founder of Shiba Inu is. In this initial thread, the researcher put forward that there was not one but two founders behind the coin. Related Reading: Grayscale Victory Sends Bitcoin Open Interest Surging After Hitting One-Year Lows Two names were put forward – Ryo Suzuki & Tsuyoshi Maruyama, a combination of which the researcher believes was used to make the widely known Ryoshi moniker. Interestingly, both of the people named were identified to be advisors of B2C2, a liquidity provider. This is where the investigator makes the connection to Shiba Inu. According to Boring Sleugh, the liquidity provider’s wallet once held 25% of the total SHIB supply in its wallet. Furthermore, they linked the two alleged founders together by pointing out that Tsuyoshi Maruyama had immediately taken over as an advisor for B2C2 when Ryo Suzuki stepped down from the role in 2021. A follow-up post from the researcher digs deeper into Suzuki’s past, tying him to an internship at Microsoft when SHIB was launched, as well as a visit to the infamous MIT media lab in 2019. Wait until I show you that Ryo Suzuki, who I believe is the real founder of $SHIB, visited MIT’s media lab in 2019. Yeah, this same media lab that links Gensler, Epstein & Gates? What if I told you the Canadian Ryo Suzuki was also an intern for Microsoft when Shiba Inu launched? https://t.co/H2PM5FNkLb pic.twitter.com/nwkUz27Cu4 — TruthLabs 🫡 (@BoringSleuth) August 31, 2023 Unveiling Shocking Connections After debuting the theories on Thursday, it seemed Boring Sleuth was not done as a continuation was posted on Friday morning. This time around, the on-chain sleuth presents theories that connect the alleged founder to prominent personalities and organizations. The first of these was a connection to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin through a series of transactions that connected the Shiba Inu deployer wallet to Buterin’s wallet. The wallet in question identified as “0x2135” was not only connected to Buterin, however. The sleuth lists out notable people and organizations the wallet has also been connected to in the tweet below: Wallet 0x2135 is connected to: Multiple Vitalik Buterin wallets CCP official Roger Lim (HATES the West) Satofishi, Binance Dev/Stakefish Founder Wanxiang (Gensler gave them special Broker Dealer license) LingLing & Multichain Dev (Crypto Cartel) Maker DAO Multisig & More 7/8 pic.twitter.com/eib84d1CQN — TruthLabs 🫡 (@BoringSleuth) September 1, 2023 The infamous gifting of half the total SHIB supply to Vitalik Buterin is also called into question, which one X user refers to as “a massive money laundering scheme.” In response, Boring Sleuth says that the ‘gift’ was a 100% tax write-off for the Ethereum founder. “He captured all the value without moving price down 1 cent,” the researcher added. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Traders Move Into Profit, But Can The Rally Continue? Despite how convincing Boring Sleuth’s theories have been for some, there is still no confirmation of who the SHIB founder(s) are. The sleuth alludes to this as well in their most recent tweet saying “If you don’t know, the Shib founder has yet to come out.” SHIB price loses $0.000008 support again | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Follow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet… Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com",Best Owie,newsbtc

Hinterreiter and Koichi Hendrawan, who help manage and organize the translation
project, as well as the teams.
A special thanks is also owed to Transifex, for providing us with special access
to their platform.
About bitcoin.org
Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti
Malmi. When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to
additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread
responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control
over the Bitcoin project. Since then, the site has been developed and
maintained by different members of the Bitcoin community.
Despite being a privately owned site, its code is open-source and there have
been thousands of commits from hundreds of contributors from all over the
world. In addition to this, over a thousand translators have helped to make the
site display natively to visitors in their own languages — now 25 different
languages and growing.
Bitcoin.org receives millions of visitors a year from people all over the world
who want to get started with and learn more about Bitcoin.",,bitcoin

A big thanks goes to these volunteers. Their work behind the scenes shouldn’t
go unnoticed, and we dedicate this blog post to recognizing them.
Each month, more and more people all around the world are hearing, reading and
learning more about Bitcoin. Seeing a business with a “Bitcoin accepted here”
sign may not be something rare for some of us anymore… but it still is for
many in a lot of places. Even though Bitcoin adoption is spreading like
wildfire, we haven’t even scratched the surface of what could be possible. In
order for knowledge to spread, information has to be freed to transmit easily
from person to person, across borders, across languages, between cultures,
philosophies, religions and ideologies. Some people say we are all Satoshi,
now. For that to ring true, we must find our voice to speak, spread and support
Bitcoin as one.
There have been tens of millions of visitors to Bitcoin.org this year alone.
About half of them speak English. The rest are millions of visitors
speaking all kinds of other languages from across the globe. For them, we rely
on volunteer translators - like the above individuals - people who translate
Bitcoin.org into their own native languages so that when people who speak them
come to Bitcoin.org, the site displays by default in their own native tongue.
There are currently 70 languages in various states of translation, 27 of which
have reached states of completion that have enabled them to be added to
Bitcoin.org. In addition, earlier this year, the developer documentation was
ported so that it could also start to be translated into other languages. It’s
important that we provide a way to help a new generation of Bitcoin developers
in non English-speaking countries learn more about Bitcoin on a technical
level, to help foster the development of new products and services, for the
people in their communities who are already interested in using it.
As one of the most visited Bitcoin websites, translating Bitcoin.org is a great
way to help Bitcoin continue to spread.
If you want to be like one of the people above and join the effort, learn how to get started.
A special thanks also goes to Simon AKA “Komodorpudel” who has spent a lot of
time co-organizing various translation-related efforts. Thank you, Simon. Lastly,
but not least, to Transifex, for graciously providing
enterprise-grade localization services to support Bitcoin.org.",,bitcoin
